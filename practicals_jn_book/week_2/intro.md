# Welcome to your second practical!

In this practical you will learn to apply preprocessing and face validation techniques with Pandas. We will do some plotting with Matplotlib and briefly look into the Seaborn package.

In this practical we will use a dataset that needs some tender loving care (TLC). It has missing values, outliers, and some problems with combined columns. To find out where these are located, we need to do some exploratory data analysis. Doing this by hand would be quite tedious.

Finally, you will learn to prepare your dataset for hypothesis testing. Oftentimes data needs to be transformed or standardised (e.g. Z-transformations). For this, you will use the sklearn package, specifically the preprocessing part.

In short, we will touch upon Descriptive Statistics & Preprocessing, Face Validation:

Standardization (e.g. Z) -scikit Learn
Rescaling
Means, median, Std
Correlation
Plotting

The dataset used is a modified version of the [Pokemon dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon) and can be obtained [here](https://github.com/Alek050/big_data_practicals/tree/main/data/week_2)
