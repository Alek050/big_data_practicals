# Welcome to your Fifth practical!

Last week, you have had your first experience with machine learning by way of Linear and Polynomial Regression. We have teached you a structured 7-step workflow to work some ML magic on your data, and today we want you to keep those 7 steps in mind. In today's practical we will be going into supervised learning again, but this time focussing on classification. 

As you might know already, supervised learning requires labeled data. Labels can be categorical (often binary) like when we have data on left and right handed people (labels: left, right), or continuous like when we have data on the height, wheight, or for example vertical jump height. Analysis of datasets with categorical labels is known as classification, while analysis of continuous labels is known as regression. Today, you will pratice classification using a dataset with biomechinical data from orthopedic patients.
