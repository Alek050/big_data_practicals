# Welcome to your Sixth practical!

During the past two weeks, you have learned about supervised learning. Hopefully by now, you have gained some hands-on experience and start to feel confident about your developing skill-set as a budding data scientist. This week we will dive into unsupervised learning: the art of clustering unlabeled data.

At this point you should feel fairly comfortable with coding in Python, and importing, inspecting and manipulating data should start to become a relatively easy - though sometimes tedious - task. Therefore, we will be working with multiple datasets this week. We will start with clustering in a familiar dataset, and then dive into different methods using some new data.


The datasets used are a modified version of the [DATEV 2018 Challenge Roth dataset](https://www.endurance-data.com/en/results/245-challenge-roth/all/) and the [Orthopedic Patients dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/biomechanical-features-of-orthopedic-patients) and can be obtained [here](https://github.com/Alek050/big_data_practicals/tree/main/data/week_6)
