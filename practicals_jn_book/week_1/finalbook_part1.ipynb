In this case it's just an integer index because we didn't specify anything. This could also have been, for example, dates or IDs. The index is a very powerful tool, especially when you start slicing your data and merging DataFrames. \n",

    "\n",
    "However, if you try to slice the row and the column at the same time you will get an error. This is because Pandas does not know if you are using integer slices or 'names' (remember that the index can be anything).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so we need a location indexer. Pandas provides two options here: ``.iloc`` and ``.loc`` ([docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html)): \n",
    "- iloc gives you traditional Python slicing \\[start:stop:step, start:stop:step\\] for \\[rows, columns\\]\n",

    "- However, loc includes both the start and stop index, this is useful because you are often looking for very specific indices with loc.\n",
    "- If you ask for a single column or row you get a Series object. If you want a dataframe instead, you can prevent this by putting the single index in a list object (like above) by using square brackets \\[...\\].\n",
    "- If you want to get all the rows of columns, you can use ``:`` .\n",
