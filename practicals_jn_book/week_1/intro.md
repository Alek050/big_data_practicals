As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates. 

The dataset used is a modified version of the [PowerLifting dataset](https://www.openpowerlifting.org) and can be obtained [here](https://github.com/Alek050/big_data_practicals/tree/main/data/week_1)
