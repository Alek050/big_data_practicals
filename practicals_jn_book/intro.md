# Welcome to the Big Data Practicals

This Jupyter Book is created as part of the Big Data for Sports and Human Movement Sciences course at the University of Groningen. The course is developed originally by Matthias Kempe, but has had many contributors to improving course over the years. Special thanks to Floris Goes, Sophie de Klerck, Rowie Janssen, and Alexander Oonk for creating, improving, and updating all code over the years.

## How to use this book

This book contains practical assingments, structured in 6 weeks. It starts with an introduction into the `pandas` package in week 1, highlighting some important data processing tools. Week 2 focusses on use of loops and functions. In week 3, the different options in visualizations are shown. These three weeks give a solid ground to go into machine learning tasks. In week 4 we will explore different regression tasks using the `scikit-learn` package. Similarly, week 5 will focus on classification algorithms. Last, week 6 will combine all skills learned by exploring different clustering algorithms. 

The different weeks build on top of each other and it is therefore advised to do them in order.

## Now Lets get Started!
This document was made in Python using [Jupyter books](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html). Output is the result of real code in IPython (interactive Python). Code blocks are hidden from view to not make the exercises too easy. You can reveal the answers, but are not encouraged to do so untill after the practical. Now fire up ``spyder`` and get started!
