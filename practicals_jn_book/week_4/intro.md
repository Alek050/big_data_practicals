# Welcome to your fourth practical!

Today, we will tip our toes in the pool that is called machine learning for the very first time. Over the next coming weeks you will learn the basics of prediction, classification & clustering, as you slowly start to learn the art of artificial intelligence. Sounds pretty fancy right? 

At this point, you might feel a little bit freightened, as algorithms, machine learning and AI all may sound very daunting to you. But don't worry, during the praticals we will break machine learning down in easy steps, and you will be using your computer for all kinds of intelligent stuff in no time. 

By now you might have learned a little bit about the different kinds of machine learning. Basically we differentiate between supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. If those words are still unfamiliar, don't bother, everything will become clear in the next couple of weeks. Today's focus will be on supervised machine learning, more specifically on regression models. 

During today's practical we will work with a concept that should feel familiar: Linear Regression. As you have all learned about regression in your statistics class, we will not bother you with too many mathematical and technical details. What we will however is extend your knowledge on linear regression by peaking into polynomial regression as well. 

The dataset used is a modified version of the [Fifa dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thec03u5/fifa-18-demo-player-dataset) and can be obtained [here](https://github.com/Alek050/big_data_practicals/tree/main/data/week_4)
