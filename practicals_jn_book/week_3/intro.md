# Welcome to your third practical!

The last practice run before the machine learning fun actually begins. The topic of this practical will be Breast Cancer. Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. The earlier we can detect this, the more we can do to help these patients fully recover. The UMCG has his own Breast Program and is specialized in providing state-of-the-art radiation therapy, including prototon therapy. Just recently, they received a [big grant](https://umcgresearch.org/w/umcg-researchers-receive-kwf-grant-for-research-into-the-effect-of-immunotherapy-in-triple-negative-breast-cancer) to conduct more research using machine learning!

In the current practical, you work with a dataset that contain features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass. Features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
